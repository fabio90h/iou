# Summary
An application that keeps track of how much money someone owes you. It gives the user an option to apply sales tax (6%) for each charge, and to view the list of charges that were marked as ‘paid’. Users are also able to edit their charges.

# Goal
This idea came to me after I couldn’t keep track of all the expenses my roommate owed me. From groceries, utilities, food take outs, and more. I used to write them all in iPhone Note app but then I would have to manually calculate everything. Also, I would forget which ones were already paid and which were not. So I wanted to make an application that could keep track of all the charges, all the paid charges, and automatically calculate the total amount owed.
